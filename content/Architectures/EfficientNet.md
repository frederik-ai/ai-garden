EfficientNet is an image classification model. It can currently be seen as the standard model on the ImageNet dataset. The purpose of this model is to achieve a high classification accuracy while still putting an emphasis on a low inference time by only using a limited number of parameters.

The authors also demonstrate that it can be used well to transfer between different datasets. It is thefore very well suitable for transfer learning.
