# What is this?
My name is Frederik and these are my personal lecture notes that I take for my [university courses](https://ekvv.uni-bielefeld.de/sinfo/publ/master-as/intsys;lang=EN). I am a M.Sc. student in the field of AI at University of Bielefeld, Germany. If you are, like me, interested in Computer Vision, Machine Learning, etc. this site might be interesting to you.
# How is this organized?
Well, it's complicated...
I am using the Zettelkasten method for note-taking. For this reason, there is no hierarchical structure in my notes. Instead, my nodes are interlinked and form a graph-like structure. You can use the search bar to look for a specific topic. Then, see to which related notes this topic is connected and delve deeper if you like. If not, search for a different topic. Also, I use tags to mark each note. For example to identify from which lecture the note stems.

Some notes to start exploring could be [[SIFT]], [[R-CNN]] or [[Markov Chain Monte Carlo]].
