The idea of neuromorphic computing is to build a computer architecture that mimics our brain. The problem with the classical Von Neumann architecture is that the transfer between CPU and memory is a huge bottleneck for deep learning.

Additionally, artificial neural networks are highly different from how neurons actually work. Neuromorphic hardware tries to exactly mimic the behavior of individual neurons. For example, each synapse should be able to remember its previous state(s). Therefore, each individual neuron needs its own memory.
