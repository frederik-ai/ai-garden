A neural network is considered deep if it has at least two hidden layers. Technically we do not need deep networks. A neural network with one hidden layer and the sigmoid activation function is a universal function approximator.

So why use deep networks?

- Deep neutral networks can solve the same task with a smaller number of neurons than a network with one hidden layer
- Deep neural networks can generalize better -> For example because they learn hierarchical features (think of CNNs where earlier layers learn fine concepts such as edges and later layers learn broad concepts such as complex shapes)
